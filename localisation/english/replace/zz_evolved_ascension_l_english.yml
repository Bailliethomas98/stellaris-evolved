After it doing its first movements, we detected a sudden pattern change in the synthetic neuroprocessors, an overload of information while the new body started to moving erratically, followed by several episodes of burst of violence against the containment environment; we had to preemptively disconnect the unit as it was risking the entire team integrity. A subsequent study indicated the subject suffered some kind of psychosis, driven by the disassociation between its own recognition, the platform new capacities and the stress of the situation, so this means that, while we achieved our goals of transferring the patterns to the platform, the experiment has been a partial failure and we must avoid the same occurrence in the future."

These rare [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] could supposedly invade the minds of their fellows, lift heavy objects with merely a thought, or perform any number of other ''magical'' feats. Until recently, these stories were just that - stories.\n\nNow, however, our scientists have finally obtained conclusive evidence that proves the potential inherent in certain [Root.GetSpeciesName] individuals. Although only a very small minority of our species as a whole seems to be gifted with such powers, their numbers relative to the total population have grown steadily over just the last few centuries.\n\nWhether this is due to some kind of sudden evolutionary growth-spurt or because something has triggered these latent abilities that were always present in our genetic code, scientists cannot say."
